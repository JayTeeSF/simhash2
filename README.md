# Simhash2

**Simhash2** is a rewrite of the [bookmate/simhash](https://github.com/bookmate/simhash) gem, which is an implementation of Moses Charikar's simhashes in Ruby. The key differences are that this gem doesn't monkey patch the `String` and `Integer`, and configuration is also slightly easier. The simhash values generated by this gem on a default configuration should be identical to what is generated by the Bookmate version.

## Installation

Install the gem from RubyGems:

```bash
gem install simhash2
```

If you use Bundler, just add it to your Gemfile and run `bundle install`

```ruby
gem 'simhash2'
```

I have only tested this gem on Ruby 2.4.1, but there shouldn't be any reason why it wouldn't work on earlier Ruby versions as well.

## Usage

```ruby
str1 = "I am the king of the world!"
str2 = "I am the queen of the world!"

simhash1 = Simhash.generate(str1) # =>
simhash2 = Simhash.generate(str2) # =>

Simhash.hamming_distance(simhash1, simhash2) # =>
```
